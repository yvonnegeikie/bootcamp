Tasks:
1:  Write a conditional statement to check a customerâ€™s age at a bar. If the customer is under 18 log a message advising they are too young, otherwise ask what they would like to drink.

2: Declare a variable called "Password". Write an if statement that checks how many characters are in the password, if the password has more than 8 characters log the password to the console, if the password has less than 8 characters log to the console that the password is too short.

3: Create a variable that stores a number. Check whether the number is divisible by 3 or 5, if so log "This number is divisible by 3 or 5" to the console. Otherwise log an alternate message to the console.

4: Create a variable that stores a number. If the number is divisible by 3, log "fizz" to the console. If the number is divisible by 5 log "buzz" to the console. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log "fizz buzz" to the console. Otherwise log the number to the console.
