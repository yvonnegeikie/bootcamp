<h1>Conditional statements</h1>
<p>Tasks:
    1: Write a conditional statement to check a customerâ€™s age at a bar. If the customer is under 18 log a message
    advising they are too young, otherwise ask what they would like to drink. <br>
    2: Declare a variable called "Password". Write an if statement that checks how many characters are in the password,
    if the password has more than 8 characters log the password to the console, if the password has less than 8
    characters log to the console that the password is too short. <br>
    3: Create a variable that stores a number. Check whether the number is divisible by 3 or 5, if so log "This number
    is divisible by 3 or 5" to the console. Otherwise log an alternate message to the console. <br>
    4: Create a variable that stores a number. If the number is divisible by 3, log "fizz" to the console. If the number

    console. Otherwise log the number to the console.</p>
