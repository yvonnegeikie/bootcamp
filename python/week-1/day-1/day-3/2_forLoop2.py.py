# for variableName in rangeObject(numberOfIteration)
# for loops that use the range() function
# range() is the sequence that you are going to iterate through
# range() is a built-in function just like input(). 


# range(stop) -> range object range(start, stop[, step]) -> range object
# When you call the range function, you can pass it up to three values: 
# The start number
# The end number
# The step 

#ToDo: Task 1: Predict, then Run, and then Investigate"

"start defaults to 0, and stop is omitted! range(4) produces 0, 1, 2, 3"
for findNum in range(10):
    print(findNum)

#ToDO: Task 2: Create a program that uses a for loop to start count from 1 to and ends at 20 "
"Task 3: Create a program that uses a for loop to start count  from 1, and increment(step) of 5 a and ends/stop at 30"
"Task 4:  Modify the code you produced in task 3 to count down in steps of 5 (from a high number(30) to a low number greater or equal to 1)"
