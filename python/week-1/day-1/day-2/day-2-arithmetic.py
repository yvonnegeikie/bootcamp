"To Do: Task 1: What is the equivalent of f-strings in JavaScript?"
# JS equivalent is template literals, using `back ticks` instead of 'single' or "double" quotes to embed expressions directly into string using ${expression}` syntax 

# Python3 program introducing f-string
# val = 'Geeks'
# print(f"{val}for{val} is a portal for {val}.") 
# GeeksforGeeks is a portal for Geeks.
 
# name = 'Yvonne'
# age = 34
# print(f"Hello, My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old.") 
# Hello, My name is Yvonne and I'm 34 years old.
