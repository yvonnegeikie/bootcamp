# check the condition that pStudy value is same as the value held in curProgram
# do something/execute the line of code if the condition is checked above true/met - welcome
# The block(else) of code will be executed if the condition in the if block is not true/not met


#ToDo: Task 1: Using if elif and else
# Create a Menu program that allows users to select between three subject choices
# User must be presented with the value assoiciated with each choice
# for example 1. Music, 2. Maths ....
# A choice must also be available for the user to exit the program
# A message using the print function must be display as per the user choice
