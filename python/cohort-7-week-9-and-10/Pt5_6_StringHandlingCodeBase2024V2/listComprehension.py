"" '' # Use List comprehension to create one list out of another list
"" '' # Compare list comprehension with non list comprehension syntax 


"" ''#  Notes
"" ''#  List comprehension consists of square brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause
"" ''#  List comprehension is a concise way to create lists
"" ''#  List comprehension gives us easy to use syntax to create one list out of another while applying some logic and condition.
"" ''#  List syntax comprehension goes into square brackets
