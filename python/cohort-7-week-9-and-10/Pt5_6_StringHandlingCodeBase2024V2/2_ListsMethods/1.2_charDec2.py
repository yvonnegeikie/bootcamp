"Objective:"
"" '' # Use chr() and ord() to perform ASCII conversion
"" '' # Create a function that returns a list
"" '' # Use randomisation to append items to a list
"" '' # Use the in operator and range function to generate a range of number to be added to a list.

"" '' # Notes
"" '' # Perform ASCII conversion in pyhon
"" '' # chr(97): takes in a decimal number and returns its character equivalent
"" '' # ord("a"): takes in a character and returns its character decimal equivalent

"" '' # To Do: Task 3: Complete the code block below to print a list of converted numbers as letters
"" '' # The question marks indicates where the code syntax is missing 
 
def alphabets(): # created the function alphabets
    alphabetList = ? # create an empty list
    for ? in range(65, 123):
        alphabetList.append(chr(letters))  # converts numbers to letters then add/append them to
    return ?
print(?)
