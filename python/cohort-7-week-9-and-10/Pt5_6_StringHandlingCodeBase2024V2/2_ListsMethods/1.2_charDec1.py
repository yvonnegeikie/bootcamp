"Objective:"
"" '' # Use chr() and ord() to perform ASCII conversion
"" '' # Create a function that returns a list
"" '' # Use randomisation to append items to a list
"" '' # Use the in operator and range function to generate a range of number to be added to a list.

"" '' # Notes
"" '' # Perform ASCII conversion in pyhon
"" '' # chr(97): takes in a decimal number and returns its character equivalent
"" '' # ord("a"): takes in a character and returns its character decimal equivalent

"" '' # To Do: Task 1:  Predict, then Run, and then Investigate the use of ord() function in python

aChar = input("Enter a character: ")
# ord("a"): takes in a character: Return the Unicode code point for a one-character string.
convertChar = ord(aChar)  # ord"(a/b/c/d")
print(convertChar)

"" '' # Task2: Modify the code above to ask for an integer value then use the chr() to return its character equivalent"
