"Objectives"
"" '' # Understand what is a parameter
"" '' # Understand what is an argument
"" '' # Use parameter(s) in function definition
"" '' # Use argument(s) in function call
"" '' # Use the pass statement


"" '' # What is a parameter and how to use it?
"" '' # Parameter(s): used in a subroutine/function to allow values to be passed into them/used as a placeholder(s)"
"" '' # in short they are variables that recieve data(value)

"" '' # What is an argument and how to use it?
"" '' # Argument(s) are the values pass wtihin the parenthesis when a function is called/invoke
"" '' # the value(s) get passed into the funtion parameter(s) during execution


"" '' # Why use parameter(s)
"" '' # 1. Customise input value 2. Reusability 3. Fexibility 4. Readability 5. Default values

"" '' # Why use arguments(s)
"" '' # 1. Function call (values passed as arguments)  2. Dynamic values(function handles different inputs) 
"" '' # 3. Multiple arguments 
"" '' # 5. Keyword arguments (pass arguments by explicitly specifying the name of the parameter(s))

"" '' # Functions that uses parameter and arguments are more modular, reuseable, adaptable , flexible and readable.

"" '' #  What is the pass statement?
"" '' #  This is a place holder used for empty code blocks within a function

"" '' #  When to use the pass statement?
"" '' #  Use it in code functions that you have define but tey to write code within it to prevent errors
