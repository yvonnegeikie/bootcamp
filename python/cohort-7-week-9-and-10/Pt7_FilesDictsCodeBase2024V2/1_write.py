"" '' # Write to text files


"" '' # Notes:
"" '' # In order to read the data stored in a text file, you must open it first. 
"" '' # Just like a book. You cant read what is inside if you dont open it first.
"" '' # There are four modes for opening a file:
"" '' # r for only reading files
"" '' # w for only writing to file and creating the file if it does not exists but overwrites existing file contents
"" '' # a for adding to an existing file
"" '' # r+ for reading and writing files


"" '' # Key file-handling techniques are:Open, Read ,Close, Write
"" '' # The text file must be saved in the same location as your Python file for the program to work.
