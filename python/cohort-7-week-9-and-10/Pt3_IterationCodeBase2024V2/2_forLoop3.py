"" '' # Understand what is a sequence
"" '' # Use a for Loop to loop through a sequence


"" '' # Notes
"" '' # for loops that use the range()function
"" '' # range() is the sequence that you are going to iterate through
"" '' # range() is a built-in function just like input(). 

"" '' # syntax
"" '' # For loop syntax with range below
"" '' # for variableName in rangeObject(numberOfIteration)
"" '' #     do this


"" '' # How to use a for loop to loop through a sequence (Numbers in a range)

"" '' # To Do: Predict, then Run, and then Investigate"

"" '' # start defaults to 0, and stop is omitted! range(4) produces 0, 1, 2, 3"
for findNum in range(10): # displays 0-9, showing 10 things 
    print(findNum)


"" '' # Additional Notes
"" '' # When you call the range function, you can pass it up to three values: 
"" '' # The start number
"" '' # The end number
"" '' # The step 
"" '' # range(stop) -> range object range(start, stop[, step]) -> range object
