"" '' # Iteration is the repetition of code blocks. For example, a while loop or a for loop.
"" '' # for loops is used when you have definite iteration (the number of iterations is known).
"" '' # for loop also controls the flow of execution in a program
"" '' # For loop is used for iterating through sequences. 


"" '' # When to use a For loop?
"" '' # For loops is used for many types of sequence, for example"

"" '' # It aims to enhance your understanding of how a for loop could achieve the same sequence traversal.
