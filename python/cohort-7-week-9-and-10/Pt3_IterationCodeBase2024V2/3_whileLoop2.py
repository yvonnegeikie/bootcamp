"" '' # Understand what is a while Loop 
"" '' # Use a while Loop to repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true

"" '' # Notes
"" '' # Iteration is the repetition of code blocks. For example, a while loop or a for loop.
"" '' # while loop is used when the number of iteration is unknown(dont know how many times you want/going to do something for)
"" '' # A while loop also controls the flow of execution in a program

# initialise the variable num with the integer value 1 
num = 1 
# start counting from the value 1 until the value 25 is reached 
while num <= 25:
    print(f"The number {num}")
    # increase the value held in the num value variable by 1 
    # num + = 1
    num = num + 1
    # the loop will do something for 25 times
