"" '' # Understand what is a while Loop 
"" '' # Use a while Loop to repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true

"" '' # Notes
"" '' # Iteration is the repetition of code blocks. For example, a while loop or a for loop.
"" '' # while loop when the number of iteration is unknown(dont know how many times you want/going to do something for)
"" '' # A while loop also controls the flow of execution in a program


"" '' # syntax

"" '' #     do this


"To Do: Predict, then Run, and then Investigate"

num = 1  # int(input("Enter a number: "))
userNum = 12

while num <= 20:  # start from 1 and keep looping to 20(condition is met)
    print(f"The number is {num}")
    num += 1
