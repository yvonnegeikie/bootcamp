"Knowledge Check"
#To DO: Write one thing you remember from what we covered so far?


"Read, Run and investigate the lines of code below"

# Variable naming convention
username = "user1"  # meaningful name

# use of camel notation when the variable is a combination of two words
userName = "user2"

 # use snake case/underscore when the variable is a combination of two words
user_name = "user3" 

user4 = "paul0045"  # meaningful name

userAge = 23  # meaningful name

firstname = "Anna"  # meaningful name and use of single quotes in value

"DON'T DO THIS"
AGE = 12  # Unless it is a constant!!
# £cash or $cash
User = "muser"  # dont start variable with upper case
# user name = # no spaces between two words in variable assignment
# 1user = "jam"# no number at start of variable name

# Avoid doing the following:
# £errr = "money"  don't use a symbol
# AGE = 12 variable name should not be in all upper cases
# Username = "toby345" # don't start variable names with upper case character
# 2username = "Coder112345" #dont start variable names with number
# user name = "test user" # no spaces between variable name/s
