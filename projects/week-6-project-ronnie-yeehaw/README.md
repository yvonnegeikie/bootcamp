## Ronnie Yeeha, singer songwriter web page 
- A project showcasing my HTML, CSS and JavaScrip skills learned in the first 6 weeks of my Software and Web Dev Bootcamp
- I used balsamiq.cloud & trello board to break the project down into manageable stages to work on 
- This is a custom-designed and hand-coded website
