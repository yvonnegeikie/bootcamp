Ronnie Yeeha is an Australian-raised songwriter  based in Montréal.

Ronnie's project connects with the familiar hum of everyday life, from heart-to-heart crushes and summer rides, to homesickness and mundane routines. It's the arrival back home after a long haul flight, it's crashing your bike but landing on your feet, and Ronnie is ready to yeeeehaw!
