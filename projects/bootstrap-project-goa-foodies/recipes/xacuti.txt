Cashew Xacuti, a vibrant vegetarian curry from Goa, India, is a symphony of creamy cashew paste, aromatic spices, and fresh flavors. This recipe is perfect for those seeking a rich and satisfying vegetarian meal.

Ingredients:
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
1 green chili, slit lengthwise (adjust for spice preference)
1 tsp coriander seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
4 cloves
2 black cardamom pods
1 cinnamon stick (2-inch)
1/2 tsp red chili powder (adjust for spice preference)
1 tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp Kashmiri chili powder (optional, for deeper color)
1 cup raw cashews, soaked for 30 minutes
1 cup chopped tomatoes
1 cup coconut milk
1 cup water (adjust for desired consistency)
Salt to taste
Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnish (optional)

Instructions:
1. Heat the oil: In a pan or pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.
2. Sauté the aromatics: Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the spices: Add the ginger-garlic paste, green chili, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom pods, and cinnamon stick. Sauté for another minute, allowing the spices to release their aroma.
4. Grind the masala: In a blender or grinder, combine the soaked cashews with a little water to create a smooth paste. Set aside.
5. Cook the spice mixture: Add the red chili powder, turmeric powder, and Kashmiri chili powder (if using) to the pan. Stir and cook for a minute, until the spices become fragrant.
6. Add tomatoes and coconut milk: Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Then, stir in the cashew paste and coconut milk. Season with salt to taste.
7. Simmer and adjust consistency: Bring the curry to a gentle simmer. Add water if needed to achieve the desired consistency. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
8. Serve and garnish: Turn off the heat and garnish with chopped fresh cilantro (optional). Serve hot with steamed rice, roti, or naan.

Tips:
For a richer and nuttier flavor, roast the cashews in a dry pan before soaking them.
You can adjust the spice level by adding more or less red chili powder and green chili.
If you don't have Kashmiri chili powder, you can use regular chili powder but reduce the quantity as it's typically hotter.
Feel free to add other vegetables like potatoes, carrots, or green beans for extra texture.
Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
Enjoy this delicious Cashew Xacuti and embark on a culinary adventure to Goa!
