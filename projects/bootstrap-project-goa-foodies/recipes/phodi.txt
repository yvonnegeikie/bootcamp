Breadfruit Phodi: A Crispy and Flavorful Goan Delight
Breadfruit Phodi, a popular Goan dish, features crispy fried breadfruit slices coated in a flavorful semolina batter. This recipe offers a simple yet satisfying vegetarian snack or side dish.

Ingredients:
1/2 medium-sized breadfruit (around 10-12 slices)
1 cup semolina (bombay rava, chiroti rava, or kesari rava are preferred)
2 tablespoons red chili powder
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 cup vegetable oil for shallow frying
Pinch of asafoetida (optional)

Instructions:
1. Prepare the breadfruit: Peel and wash the breadfruit. Cut it into thin slices, ideally around 1/4 inch thick. Submerge the slices in water to prevent browning as you prepare the batter.
2. Make the batter: In a bowl, combine the semolina, red chili powder, and salt. Add a pinch of asafoetida (optional) for extra flavor. If using, dissolve it in a little water first. Mix well to create a dry batter with a slight red tinge.
3. Heat the oil: Pour vegetable oil into a pan or wok and heat it over medium heat. Aim for a temperature hot enough for shallow frying, around 350°F (175°C).
4. Coat the breadfruit: Remove the breadfruit slices from the water one by one and pat them dry with a paper towel. Dredge each slice in the semolina batter, ensuring it's evenly coated.
5. Shallow fry: Carefully place the coated breadfruit slices into the hot oil. Don't overcrowd the pan. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy.
6. Drain and serve: Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried breadfruit slices to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Serve hot immediately, as they are best enjoyed crispy.

Tips:
Choose a slightly unripe breadfruit for a firmer texture that holds the coating well during frying.
Adjust the amount of red chili powder to your spice preference.
You can substitute semolina with rice flour for a slightly different texture.
If the batter seems too thick, add a tablespoon or two of water to achieve a consistency that coats the breadfruit easily.
For a tangy twist, add a teaspoon of tamarind extract or lemon juice to the batter.
Breadfruit Phodi pairs well with coconut chutney or a simple tomato dip.
Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a day. However, they might lose some crispness.
