Bebinca: The Queen of Goan Desserts
Bebinca, a layered masterpiece hailing from Goa, India, is a rich and decadent dessert that requires patience but rewards you with an explosion of flavors. This recipe guides you through creating this traditional treat.

Ingredients:
Wet Ingredients:
750 ml (3 cups) full-fat coconut milk
12 egg yolks
450 grams (2 cups) granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg (optional)
Dry Ingredients:
200 grams (1 3/4 cups) all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom (optional)
1/4 teaspoon salt
Additional:
100 grams (1/2 cup) clarified butter (ghee)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven: Set your oven to 180°C (350°F).
1. Separate the eggs: Carefully separate the egg yolks from the whites. You won't need the egg whites for this recipe.
2. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar: In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and granulated sugar until light and creamy, and almost doubled in volume.
3. Combine dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, cinnamon (if using), cardamom (if using), and salt. This ensures a smooth batter.
4. Incorporate the dry ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating between the coconut milk and the flour mixture. Whisk well after each addition to ensure a smooth batter without lumps.
5. Prepare the baking dish: Grease a deep baking dish (around 9 inches in diameter) with a spoonful of clarified butter.
6. Layer by layer magic: Using a ladle, pour a thin layer of batter (around 1/4 inch thick) into the prepared dish. Spread it evenly.
7. Bake and brown: Bake this first layer in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, or until golden brown on top.
8. Ghee and repeat: While the first layer is baking, melt a tablespoon of clarified butter. Once the first layer is golden brown, remove the dish from the oven. Immediately brush the hot layer with the melted ghee.
9. Pour the next layer: Carefully pour another thin layer of batter on top of the browned layer. Spread it evenly.
10. Repeat baking and layering: Repeat steps 8-10 until all the batter is used. You might achieve around 10-16 layers, depending on the thickness.
11. Brown the top: After adding the last layer, bake the bebinca for a final 5-7 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.
12. Cool and serve: Once baked, remove the bebinca from the oven and let it cool completely in the baking dish at room temperature. This can take several hours.
13. Slice and enjoy: When cool, carefully run a knife along the edges of the bebinca to loosen it from the dish. Then, slice and serve.

Tips:
Traditionally, bebinca is baked using a special earthenware oven called a tizal. However, a regular oven works well for this recipe.
Be patient! Baking multiple thin layers takes time, but it's key to achieving the signature texture of bebinca.
Use a thin, flat-bottomed ladle for pouring consistent layers of batter.
Ensure the clarified butter is hot when brushing between layers for optimal absorption.
You can adjust the amount of spices (cinnamon and cardamom) to your preference.
Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. However, the bebinca might lose some of its crispness.
Bebinca is best enjoyed at room temperature.
Enjoy this delicious and traditional Goan dessert!
