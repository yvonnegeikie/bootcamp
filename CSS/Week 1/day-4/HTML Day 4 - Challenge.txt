HTML Day 4 - Challenge:
 
Using the landing page structure you put together yesterday, I would like you to refactor the code using Semantic HTML.
 
Research Semantic HTML elements in order to build an understanding of how and when they are used before appropriately applying it to the layout that you put together yesterday.
