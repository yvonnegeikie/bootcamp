CSS Position Task:
 
Using the CSS Position Property, I would like you to put together an example of the following:
 
An element that is fixed to the top of the page when scrolled past.
 
An element that is fixed in the same position of the browser despite where you scroll to in the document.
Eg. a simple navigation bar and an social media.
