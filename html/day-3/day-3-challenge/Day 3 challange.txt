HTML Day 3 - Challenge:

I would like you to put together the HTML code for a website homepage for an imaginary business. The type of business is completely your choice, it can be a Coffeeshop, a Gym, a Florist whatever you like.

The page must use the appropriate HTML document structure and make use of appropriate HTML elements throughout.

The website must include the following: 
 
 
An updated Favicon
An embedded YouTube video
An embedded Google Map
Appropriate use of id's and Classes
 
 
If you wish to do so feel free to try and add some basic styling, however, as we haven't covered CSS there is no obligation to do so.
