HTML - Day 1 - Challenge:
Using HTML I would like you to put together a webpage. Your webpage must include appropriate HTML document structure and at least one working example of each of the following elements:
A Heading
A Paragraph
An Anchor
An Image
A List
A Table
Some of the above elements we have not yet covered. Make use of the resources such as MDN to research these elements and how they can be added to your HTML.
