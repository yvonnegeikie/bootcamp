Each breakout room will be assigned a topic, I would like you to research your topic and put together a short demonstration / presentation on it to present to the group later in the session.

How you demo / explain your topic is up to you to decide as a group. Feel free to share your screen and do a code-along demo or explain it using a presentation of some sort. Please ensure that you organise amongst yourselves who will share their screen and who will present what.

We will be coming back into the main meeting room at 11:45 in order to run through the presentations.

Research The data structures below:

--Room 1: Lists
--Room 2: Set
--Room 3: Dictionary
--Room 4: Tuple - Yvonne, Bergard, Jack 

Benefits of Tuples in Python:

Immutability: Tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be modified after creation. This ensures data integrity and prevents accidental changes, making them ideal for representing fixed sets of values.
Efficiency: Due to their immutability, tuples can be stored and accessed more efficiently than lists, especially for smaller-sized collections. The Python interpreter knows that their elements won't change, allowing for optimizations in memory management and access.
Hashability: Tuples can be used as dictionary keys because they are immutable and hashable. This means that their contents can be uniquely identified, and dictionaries rely on unique keys to retrieve values associated with them. Lists, on the other hand, cannot be used as dictionary keys due to their mutability.
Clarity: By using tuples, you explicitly convey that a collection of values should not be modified, making your code more readable and maintainable. This can be particularly helpful in situations where accidental changes to data could have unintended consequences.
